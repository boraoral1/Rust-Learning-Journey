# 🦀 Rust Learning Journey

Welcome to my Rust programming portfolio! 
This repository serves as a documentation of my progress in learning **Rust**, focusing on system programming and cybersecurity concepts.

## 🚀 Repository Contents

This collection covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

* **Core Concepts:** Variables, Mutability, and Control Flow.
* **Memory Safety:** Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes.
* **Data Structures:** Structs, Enums, and Collections.
* **Error Handling:** Using `Result` and `Option` types effectively.
* **Networking & Security:** Building tools like **Port Scanners** (Nmap logic) and TCP simulations.

## 🛠️ Goal
My goal is to master low-level system programming and apply these skills to create efficient cybersecurity tools.
